[Skroutz](http://www.skroutz.gr/company/el) being a Gaia sponsor of EuRuKo was pleasantly inevitable!
The Skroutz team has assisted in the preliminary preparations and support and has been waiting for
EuRuKo so badly, that we just couldn’t stop them from being our top sponsors. Furthermore,
their willingness to become EuRuKo 2013 Gaia sponsor is justified by the fact that there is a
striving Ruby community within Skroutz team.

Skroutz.gr began as a hobby project, in order to help three ordinary guys to find, organize
and compare prices for their favorite gadgets. This tech-eCommerce startup came to life
in 2005 from a small-scale team of three people. Today, Skroutz.gr is a leading ecommerce
brand in Greece consisting of passionate individuals; a diverse range of people with an
unequalled spectrum of skills and capabilities which tackle the challenges of creating and
creatively extending expectations. A team of 40+ top-class professionals consist the working
force behind the best price comparison engine in Greece and the number is always growing :)

The “force” between Skroutz.gr and Ruby is strong. Skroutz.gr is built on RoR and takes
full advantage of all the magical features which Ruby programming language offers. As
mentioned previously, several members of the Greek Ruby community “live” and enhance
their experience within Skroutz by undertaking and creating really amazing projects.

Apart from Skroutz.gr many ambitious projects have arisen during the course of the last 8
years, including [Skroutzstore](http://www.skroutzstore.gr/home) (a user-friendly platform for the creation of a fully operational
e-shop in just 10 minutes), [Skroutz MyBill](http://mybill.skroutz.gr/) (a spin off which extends comparison portfolio
to telecommunication services), [Soby](http://www.soby.gr/) (the first deal aggregator in Greece) and recently
[Alve.com](http://www.alve.com/) (a price comparison engine adjusted to the needs of the Turkism market).

As they say technology and innovation is part of the company’s DNA. This part of their DNA,
is the one they want to spread among the EuRuKo 2013 audience, while facilitating the
exchange of ideas and experiences from the Ruby challenges they face every day.
