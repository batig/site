&lt;p&gt;Once again, &lt;a href='http://www.wooga.com/'&gt;Wooga&lt;/a&gt; supports EuRuKo and we are extremely happy about it! Immediately after last year’s Athens nomination, Wooga contacted us and told us they wanted to support this year’s effort. In doing so, Wooga, took a (heavy) chip off of our shoulders. They did so perhaps because members of the Wooga family had organised EuRuKo 2011, perhaps because they are too cool&amp;#8230; we don’t know. But we thank them :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wooga was founded to create computer games for everyone. They develop games with a special focus on emotional characters, good usability and superb localisation in seven languages. No consoles or high-end computers are needed to enjoy Wooga games, making it easy for every player to connect with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say, they develop social games with love in Berlin. They certainly showed EuRuKo their love again this year and we should all thank them for that!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.skroutz.gr/company/en?from=euruko_blog'&gt;Skroutz&lt;/a&gt; being a Gaia sponsor of EuRuKo was pleasantly inevitable! The Skroutz team has assisted in the preliminary preparations and support and has been waiting for EuRuKo so badly, that we just couldn’t stop them from being our top sponsor. Furthermore, their willingness to become EuRuKo 2013 Gaia sponsor is justified by the fact that there is a thriving Ruby community within the Skroutz team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skroutz.gr began as a hobby project in order to help three ordinary guys find, organize and compare prices for their favorite gadgets. This tech-eCommerce startup came to life in 2005 from a small-scale team of three people. Today, Skroutz.gr is a leading ecommerce brand in Greece consisting of passionate individuals; a diverse range of people with a spectrum of skills and capabilities which tackle the challenges of creating and creatively extending expectations. A team of 40+ top-class professionals make up the working force behind the best price comparison engine in Greece and the number is always growing :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “force” between Skroutz.gr and Ruby is strong. Skroutz.gr is built on RoR and takes full advantage of all the magical features which the Ruby programming language offers. As already mentioned, several members of the Greek Ruby community “live” and enhance their experience within Skroutz by undertaking and creating really amazing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Skroutz.gr many ambitious projects were built during the course of the last 8 years, including &lt;a href='http://www.skroutzstore.gr/home'&gt;Skroutzstore&lt;/a&gt; (a user-friendly platform for the creation of a fully operational e-shop in just 10 minutes), &lt;a href='http://mybill.skroutz.gr/'&gt;Skroutz MyBill&lt;/a&gt; (a spin off which extends comparison portfolio to telecommunication services), &lt;a href='http://www.soby.gr/'&gt;Soby&lt;/a&gt; (the first deal aggregator in Greece) and recently &lt;a href='http://www.alve.com/'&gt;Alve.com&lt;/a&gt; (a price comparison engine adjusted to the needs of the Turkish market).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;After so many months of preparation, finally the wait is over! So mark the date: tickets go on sale on &lt;strong&gt;Friday 12th of April, &lt;a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=EuRuKo+2013+1st+ticket+batch%21&amp;amp;iso=20130412T14"&gt;14:00 UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; through &lt;a href="https://www.eventora.com/en/Events/euruko-2013-athens"&gt;Eventora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi Rubyists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so many months of preparation, finally the wait is over! So mark the date: tickets go on sale on &lt;strong&gt;Friday 12th of April, &lt;a href='http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=EuRuKo+2013+1st+ticket+batch%21&amp;amp;iso=20130412T14'&gt;14:00 UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; through &lt;a href='https://www.eventora.com/en/Events/euruko-2013-athens'&gt;Eventora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Soon' src='/images/blog/soon.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='how_much'&gt;How much?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ticket price is going to be &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;#8364;&lt;/strong&gt;. As you may know, EuRuKo has traditionally been a conference with a very reasonable ticket price. The reason is simple: it&amp;#8217;s an event organized by the community for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been possible without the love of our &lt;a href='/#sponsors'&gt;sponsors&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='how_many_tickets'&gt;How many tickets?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tickets will be released in batches and the first batch is going to be &lt;strong&gt;100 tickets&lt;/strong&gt;. More will follow of course :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='so_what_do_i_get_with_a_ticket'&gt;So what do I get with a ticket?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly you get to come to a conference where &lt;a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals'&gt;you can decide who is going to speak&lt;/a&gt;! In case you haven’t noticed our call for proposals has opened and we already have many awesome presentations. On top of that, you can meet &lt;a href='/#speakers'&gt;Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='/#speakers'&gt;Koichi Sasada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='/#speakers'&gt;Steve Klabnik&lt;/a&gt; who have already confirmed they are going to speak at this year’s EuRuKo. One last thing: you know that you cannot come to Athens and not have a party! That’s all been taken care of by our &lt;a href='/#sponsors'&gt;sponsors&lt;/a&gt; :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#8217;t wait to see you in Athens! Until then, you can &lt;a href='/#tickets'&gt;watch the countdown&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href='/#venue'&gt;Venue&lt;/a&gt; is magnificent as you &amp;#8216;ll witness yourself firsthand when you join us in Athens. Everything is going as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have lots of work to do before we&amp;#8217;re ready to welcome you to Athens this June for EuRuKo 2013, however we are getting there. Our &lt;a href='/blog/2013-03-28-call-for-presentations/'&gt;CFP is open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals'&gt;a lot of proposals have been submitted&lt;/a&gt; already. We suggest you get a look at them and vote for those you like and make suggestions to improve the ones you feel need a more thorough description. And why not read the process and &lt;a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about'&gt;submit your own proposal&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really soon, we will announce the &lt;a href='/#tickets'&gt;first batch of tickets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned and follow us closely on &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/euruko'&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href='/blog/feed.xml'&gt;blog feed&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href='http://eepurl.com/w3D21'&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to reassure you here are a couple more images from the &lt;a href='/'&gt;EuRuKo 2013&lt;/a&gt; awesome Venue:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the images below the venue of this year&amp;#8217;s EuRuKo, Badminton Theatre, is being renovated. To be honest, we knew such works were planned, yet we chose to book this amazing &lt;a href='/#venue'&gt;venue&lt;/a&gt; because it was impressive, and with the recently planned renovation it would be really awesome. It was a bold and risky move due to the recent economic difficulties Greece is facing right now (including workers&amp;#8217; strikes). What we wanted, was to have the greatest and biggest venue &lt;a href='http://euruko2013.org'&gt;EuRuKo&lt;/a&gt; had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Badminton Scene Renovation' src='/images/blog/badminton_scene_renovation.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were promised that the venue would be ready by April, yet when we went there earlier today to inspect the premises we where dumbfounded to discover that the works are midway, with an estimate of late August finish at best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organising committee, along with all of our the amazing volunteers and venue construction crews are working hard to help with construction works. However, we can&amp;#8217;t make any promises yet. We will inform you of our progress as we approach the June deadline. In the mean time &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/euruko'&gt;follow us on twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://eepurl.com/w3D21'&gt;sign up for our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; in order to stay informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Badminton Floor Renovation' src='/images/blog/badminton_floor_renovation.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee promises to pull its sleeves up and dive into hard work with the shovel in order to organize EuRuKo 2013 on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

We have put a lot of effort in order to create a selection process that will encourage submissions by everyone irrespective of publicity, gender, race, domain, etc, guarantee a high quality conference and at the same time be fun for all participants. The process has been refined with feedback from the community and all the details can be found &lt;a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So mark the dates and get engaged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit your proposal! We are pretty sure that almost everyone has something interesting to share!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Help refine the proposals: comment, suggest, criticise and show your love :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Spread the news to the proper channels: your local ruby user groups, your blog, your circles!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;and one last thing: you know how hard it is to find a ticket for EuRuKo usually, right? They tend to sell out in seconds. Well, this year, we are reserving a priority line for active participants in the CfP process along some other goodies that may come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are you waiting for? &lt;a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org'&gt;Join the party&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
