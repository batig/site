      <section class="body" itemprop="text">
        <p>From the very first <a href='http://euruko2013.org'>EuRuKo 2013</a> organisers’ meetup we decided that whatever we do will be solely for the benefit of the community. Aside from agreeing that we want EuRuKo 2013 to be an amazing conference we also promised ourselves that even if it doesn’t match our lofty expectations the community should gain something. Sometimes these decisions become a tall order for all of us in the organisers team as we try to make everything perfect. However these are the core principles under which we decided to operate.</p>

<p>Each of us spends many hours and even man-days every week in order to analyse and execute the tasks which we have to complete until our next weekly meeting. We are nine people on this committee whose input amounts for many man-days of effort every month. None of us has ever done something like EuRuKo before (not even remotely close) so we’re figuring it out as we go along. We have hired event management professionals to assist us, yet we are involved in every little detail of this conference even to the point of exhaustion sometimes.</p>

<p>We started working on EuRuko 2013 immediately after Athens won the nomination for EuRuKo 2013 in the summer of 2012 and since last September we meet every Wednesday and sometimes Fridays and weekends too for (too) many hours in order to review, design, allocate and decide on tasks towards our goal of making this the best EuRuko we can. Since the summer of 2012 team members engage daily in various activities so that progress is made week after week. For example during the weekends of October and November we were surveying all the top venues in Athens for example and during December and January members of the team had to skip work to deal with government bureaucracy in order to found our non-profit company which is necessary to deal with suppliers, sponsors etc.</p>

<p>Many times we are even hard on ourselves when we don’t do something as well as we thought we could. It sounds scary but at the beginning we didn’t even know how to approach our weekly task allocation never mind completing them. Alas we made many many mistakes to the point of break-up. However we persisted and now we’ve found our rhythm and every day we are more confident that we are on the right track. Above all we feel that we improve week after week and that our goal is getting closer by the day. Our commitment yields a lot of hard work; hard work that should not only lead to a top conference but also to something greater.</p>

<p>As a result, we have decided to publicly release upon the completion of the conference on the 29th of June 2013 all of our documentation, private discussions, decisions, spreadsheets, meeting minutes, supplier contracts, budgets and everything else we’ve produced.</p>

<p>During our journey so far we have asked ourselves in numerous occasions what have others done before us and how problems similar to ours were dealt with and so many times we have not found adequate answers. As a consequence we will be releasing everything to the world in the hope that subsequent EuRuKos will build on our effort and that other community-driven conference committees can improve on our mistakes and successes (because all of them are recorded :-)).</p>

<p>We love learning, experimenting and sharing knowledge because above all we believe we can improve our world. We hope that the honour, which the Ruby community has bestowed upon this unfairly tarnished part of our globe, can be turned into benefit for everyone inside and outside of the Ruby community! So, thank you for your trust and please accept our contribution, it is coming soon&#8230;</p>
